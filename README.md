# Tic-tac-toe
This is the official repo for the TIC-TAC-TOE project (if you can call it a project)

# I would call this FAQ, but noone have ever asked any questions, because this is new

What's this project about?
Making a tic-tac-toe game (in C++) which's code is in the shape of TIC-TAC-TOE
Can I contribute, modify, ...?
Yes, but I would ask you to credit me (for the idea and if you used my code, if you did not use my code, just for the idea pls)
Can I make money from a modified version of this?
Yes (still don't forget to credit me somewhere), but I really don't know who'd pay for this crap lol :)
