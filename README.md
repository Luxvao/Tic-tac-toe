# Tic-tac-toe
This is the official repo for the TIC-TAC-TOE project (if you can call it a project)

# I would call this FAQ, but no one have ever asked any questions, because this is new

What's this project about?
Making a tic-tac-toe game (in C++) which's code is in the shape of TIC-TAC-TOE
Can I contribute, modify, ...?
Yes, but I would ask you to credit me (for the idea and if you used my code, if you did not use my code, just for the idea pls)
Can I make money from a modified version of this?
Yes (still don't forget to credit me somewhere), but I really don't know who'd pay for this crap lol :)
What's with the comments?
You have to understand me, I am planning on removing them completely (and the codeBox), but for now please understand me, maybe YOU can fix it! If you end up sacrificing some time of your life to this project don't hesitate to tell me :)

#  What now?

You can clone this repo and work on your own project if you like.
Also if I'll have any time I'll try to update this with maybe more compact, better looking code (my first challange would be removing the codeBox... you'll see what I mean)

# How to run

I didn't make any make files or things like that just compile it yourself pls (g++ TIC-TAC-TOE.cpp) and then run the executable. If for any reason it doesn't work, just tell me, I think it should work on Windows but I didn't test it (I'm on Linux).

# Features

The "game" has a 2 player mode, but I didn't have time to add checking for wins (will prob come in the future, but it does check for draws after 9 turns). It also doesn't have any AI, because of the same reason as above, but this is also planned.
Recap: So you can play it, if someone wins you press CTRL + C and if it's a draw it will display. On the start there will be a drawn game board, that will be redrawn after every turn with the updates.

# I hope you enjoy this little project of mine

# DISCLAIMERS: PLEASE DON'T JUST STEAL MY WORK, CREDIT ME AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE FREE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THIS PROJECT, THANK YOU
