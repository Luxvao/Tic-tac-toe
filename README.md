# Tic-tac-toe
This is the official repo for the TIC-TAC-TOE project (if you can call it a project)

# I would call this FAQ, but no one have ever asked any questions, because this is new

What's this project about?
Making a tic-tac-toe game (in C++) which's code is in the shape of TIC-TAC-TOE
Can I contribute, modify, ...?
Yes, but I would ask you to credit me (for the idea and if you used my code, if you did not use my code, just for the idea pls)
Can I make money from a modified version of this?
Yes (still don't forget to credit me somewhere), but I really don't know who'd pay for this crap lol :)
What's with the comments?
You have to understand me, I am planning on removing the completely (and the codeBox), but for now please understand me, maybe YOU can fix it! If you end up sacrificing some time of your life to this project don't hesitate to tell me :)

#  What now?

You can clone this repo and work on your own project if you like.
Also if I'll have any time I'll try to update this with maybe more compact, better looking code (my first challange would be removing the codeBox... you'll see what I mean)
